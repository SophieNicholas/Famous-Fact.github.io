 Actor Addicts, allows you to search for a movie and displays the top news relating to the movie, the plot, director and actors, the films poster and ratings as well as gifs related to the film. As actor addicts we waste crucial time swapping between websites to find all the details on a film we are interested in. Now it is all in one place! What are you all going to do now with that extra spare time?

## Challenges
Our initial idea was to search a specific actor – could not find a movie API which allowed this. SOLUTION: search for movie title. Initially we would find a quote from a film – could not find suitable API which allowed this. SOLUTION: find news on film. GIPHY API for certain film titles would not display related to the movie. SOLUTION:?? Could say future development.

Successes
• Worked very well together, helped each other with code. Regularly messaged in chat
and used scrums effectively. Found the special project board very useful in tracking
each person’s roles/duties and their completion +issues
