 Actor Addict, allows you to search for a movie and displays the top news relating to the movie, the plot, director and actors, the films poster and ratings as well as gifs related to the film. As actor addicts we waste crucial time swapping between websites to find all the details on a film we are interested in. Now it is all in one place! What are you all going to do now with that extra spare time?

## User Story
As an entertainment buff I want to find information on my favourite movie so that I can win trivia nights.

## Technology Used
**Server side APIs:**
* [Omdb](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
* [Giphy](https://giphy.com/)
* [G News](https://gnews.io/)

**CSS framework:**
* [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)

**3rd party APIs:**
* [JQuery](https://api.jquery.com/)
* [Moment](https://momentjs.com/)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Challenges
Our initial idea was to search a specific actor – could not find a movie API which allowed this. SOLUTION: search for movie title. Initially we would find a quote from a film – could not find suitable API which allowed this. SOLUTION: find news on film. GIPHY API for certain film titles would not display related to the movie future development. Throughout the creation of this application we have learnt how to collaborate professionally, use Github branches and merging to work simultaneously.

## Future Development
* search for quotes, actors + directors
* include musicians and search for music lyrics
* make giphy results more specific
* carosel for images of the film/actor/musician
